## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

Lab 6, part 1
This lab was pretty interesting as we made a code that had the user build their sandwich and input the protein, bread, and condiment. Doing this we had to use command line arguments. Once they input the items then we output their order on their screen.

Lab 7
One of my favorite labs was lab 7 as to me it was challenging and different compared to the rest of the labs. We created a code that displayed times that were allowed to park at a certain location and time. We had the users input a time at a place and it would output if it was a valid time or not. We had to use bool as we had to determine if the input was true or false.

Lab 8, part 1
I enjoyed Lab 8 part 1 because I found it interesting how we basically made a calculator to find an average between the given numbers. We used for loops and double types to make this code work. It gave me a better understanding of for loops to use them properly for other labs.
